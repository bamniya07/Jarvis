Dear Mr. Smith,

I am writing to request a sick leave of absence from work for a period of three days, from April 6, 2025 to April 8, 2025. Unfortunately, I am currently unwell and am experiencing a high fever and sore throat, which is affecting my ability to perform my duties.

Due to my condition, I require a brief period of rest and recuperation to recover fully. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will ensure that all my tasks are caught up upon my return to work.

As per company policy, I will provide a medical certificate from my doctor to support my application for sick leave. Please let me know if there are any additional requirements or procedures that I need to follow.

I appreciate your understanding and approval of my request. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

John Doe
